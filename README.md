Project Title: AI-Based Poultry Disease Detection Using Image Classification

Description:
This project aims to detect poultry diseases by analyzing images of chickens through a web-based application. Users can upload an image of a chicken, and the system uses a trained machine learning model to determine whether the chicken is healthy or diseased. If a disease is detected, the system identifies the specific condition (e.g., Fowl Pox, Newcastle Disease, Coccidiosis) and provides relevant information. The model was trained using a dataset of poultry images, applying deep learning techniques (such as Convolutional Neural Networks) for accurate classification. This tool can help poultry farmers detect diseases early, reduce losses, and improve farm management efficiency.
